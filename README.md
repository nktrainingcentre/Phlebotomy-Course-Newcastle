# Phlebotomy-Course-Newcastle
The HLT37215 Certificate III in Pathology Collection at Newcastle is a nationally recognised Australian qualification for becoming a pathology collector (sometimes also called a phlebotomist).
It is an entry-level course which provides hands-on training in collecting blood and other specimens like swabs, urine, sputum, ECGs, for diagnostic testing in hospitals, pathology labs, and clinics. All enrolling students will also be versed in infection control, patient interaction, and workplace health and safety.

At NK Training, we follow a rigorous training approach that combines classroom-based learning, practical hands-on training in a simulated environment. During the mandatory work placement experience, students will gain the exposure and skills required to enter their choice of healthcare set-up and assist with accurate diagnostic testing and patient care.
